Exposes the Fully Kiosk Browser app to Home Assistant as a device with multiple entites. This is possible through the Fully Kiosk Browser REST API.

This repo is a modification of the same [Core integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/fully_kiosk/), but here support for HTTPS is added.

This integration must be added to HA as a custom component. Recommended way is to add the [repository](https://github.com/r01k/ha_fully_kiosk) to HACS.
